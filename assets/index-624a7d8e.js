A style document is a [JSON](http://www.json.org/) object with specific root level and nested properties. This specification defines and describes these properties.\n\nThe intended audience of this specification includes:\n\n-   Advanced designers and cartographers who want to write styles by hand.\n-   Developers using style-related features of [MapLibre GL JS](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) or the [MapLibre Maps SDK for Android](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native).\n-   Authors of software that generates or processes MapLibre styles.\n\n## Style document structure\n\nA MapLibre style consists of a set of [root properties](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root), some of which describe a single global property, and some of which contain nested properties. Some root properties, like [`version`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root/#version), [`name`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root/#name), and [`metadata`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root/#metadata), donâ€™t have any influence over the appearance or behavior of your map, but provide important descriptive information related to your map. Others, like [`layers`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/layers) and [`sources`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/sources), are critical and determine which map features will appear on your map and what they will look like. Some properties, like [`center`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root/#center), [`zoom`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root/#zoom), [`pitch`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root/#pitch), and [`bearing`](/maplibre-gl-style-spec/root/#bearing), provide the map renderer with a set of defaults to be used when initially displaying the map.\n";function i(){return t(e,{content:r})}export{i as default};
